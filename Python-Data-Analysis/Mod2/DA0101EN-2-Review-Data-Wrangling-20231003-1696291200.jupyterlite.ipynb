Numerical variables should have type 'float' or 'int', and variables with strings such as categories should have type 'object'. For example, the numerical values 'bore' and 'stroke' describe the engines, so you should expect them to be of the type 'float' or 'int'; however, they are shown as type 'object'. You have to convert data types into a proper format for each column using the \"astype()\" method.</p> \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"59475b98-d818-44c8-a30c-6366a574f588","metadata":{},"source":["<h4>Convert data types to proper format</h4>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"id":"c59a9c63-c3cb-4b11-9204-425f546b32a3","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df[[\"bore\", \"stroke\"]] = df[[\"bore\", \"stroke\"]].astype(\"float\")\n","df[[\"normalized-losses\"]] = df[[\"normalized-losses\"]].astype(\"int\")\n","df[[\"price\"]] = df[[\"price\"]].astype(\"float\")\n","df[[\"peak-rpm\"]] = df[[\"peak-rpm\"]].astype(\"float\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ed5cfeb-6aea-41df-900e-536534034bd2","metadata":{},"source":["<h4>Let us list the columns after the conversion</h4>\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"id":"ed3cf382-45b5-4c9b-a629-dbca59a40842","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["symboling              int64\n","normalized-losses      int32\n","make                  object\n","fuel-type             object\n","aspiration            object\n","num-of-doors          object\n","body-style            object\n","drive-wheels          object\n","engine-location       object\n","wheel-base           float64\n","length               float64\n","width                float64\n","height               float64\n","curb-weight            int64\n","engine-type           object\n","num-of-cylinders      object\n","engine-size            int64\n","fuel-system           object\n","bore                 float64\n","stroke               float64\n","compression-ratio    float64\n","horsepower            object\n","peak-rpm             float64\n","city-mpg               int64\n","highway-mpg            int64\n","price                float64\n","dtype: object"]},"execution_count":29,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"60a0c303-5fb8-435e-a290-b81f9164280f","metadata":{},"source":["<b>Wonderful!</b>\n","\n","Now you finally obtained the cleansed data set with no missing values and with all data in its proper format.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f329541f-ddc9-4387-90d7-f459f95e328a","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Standardization\n","<p>\n","You usually collect data from different agencies in different formats.\n","(Data standardization is also a term for a particular type of data normalization where you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.)\n","</p>\n","    \n","<b>What is standardization?</b>\n","<p>Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format, allowing the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.\n","</p>\n","\n","<b>Example</b>\n","<p>Transform mpg to L/100km:</p>\n","<p>In your data set, the fuel consumption columns \"city-mpg\" and \"highway-mpg\" are represented by mpg (miles per gallon) unit.
